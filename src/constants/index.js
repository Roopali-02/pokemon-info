    "Moves fall under three categories. Physical and Special moves are attacking moves that will do damage to the opponent. Status moves, as the name implies, change the status of a pokemon in some way - for example raising or lowering either the attacker's or opponent's stats, inflicting a burn or causing confusion.",
    'In the early games, Physical attacks were any moves of the types Normal, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Bug, Rock, Ghost or Steel; Special attacks were those having the Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Ice, Psychic, Dragon or Dark type.',
    "In Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl, however, each attacking move is categorised individually: moves of any type can be Physical or Special. So now we have some Fighting moves in the Special category, Psychic moves in the Physical category and so on. This has led to much more interesting and diverse movesets to take advantage of a Pokémon's stat strengths."
